# ADM-HW3-Group17

* Group 17 is formed by Lorenzo Petroni and Francesca Casarano

## In this repository:

1. ADM_HW3_main.ipynb = Jupyter notebook containing the code for the third homework.

  As a dataset we used the .tsv files created by parsing the first 300 pages of books, as required by the specifications of the homework.  <br>
  To optimize the time we worked in parallel by dividing the set of books to process. And the whole set of articles to create.  <br>
  Given the use of two different operating systems we had to use two different encodings to be able to carry on operations. This bring us some difficulties to use the files      computed in two different PCs. So we decided to merge all our files and data structures.  <br>
  In the final code we kept working functions with the general proper encoding.  <br>

2. BookLinks file with urls
